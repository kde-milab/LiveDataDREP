# Distribution REPository

Distribution REPository: the last repository partition contains the data ready to be distributed. We can say that the distribution repository (DREP) contains a subset of the data stored in the core repository. Such data has been properly described by a dedicated set of metadata (the metadata are stored in the DREP together with the relative data). The metadata are published on the LiveData catalogs (see next subsection), where the users can look for the resources they want to access (request and download).
